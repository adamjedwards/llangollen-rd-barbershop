# Llangollen Road Barbershop
Sitting the chair of my local barbershop I was telling the concept of the code institue course, he explained to me the lack of web presence his shop has which led me to the idea of designing a webpage for a barbershop.

The site will contain a booking form, a list of services that the barbershop will provide along with a pricelist. a portfolio of images from the barbers clients and a page that introduces each of the members of staff.

# Webpage Vaildation and Testing

Manual testing was done by checking each feature in a preview browser before pushing to githib. 

# Features

* navbar

When landing on the webpage you will be introduced to a navbar which will include links to the home page, service, portfolio and each of the members of staff.

* Landing image

The background image will include an overlay jumbotron imported using bootstrap, here is where you can book your appointment.

* Services

As you scroll down (or click Services tab) you will come across the services section. here you can see a pricelist and an explaination of each type of cut. When hovering over each service it will highlight across the table to make it more readable. 

When viewing on a mobile platform the description will not be didsplayed to make it more readable.

* Footer

The footer will include external links to facebook, instagram and twitter, each link will open a new tab when opened. 


* Wireframes

As you can see I have changed my design from wireframe to live page. I think it was more user friendly and more intuitive to the user to use a modal function instead of on a separate page to access the booking form.
