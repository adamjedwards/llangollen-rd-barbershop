# Llangollen Road Barbershop
Sitting the chair of my local barbershop I was telling the concept of the code institue course, he explained to me the lack of web presence his shop has which led me to the idea of designing a webpage for a barbershop.

The site will contain a booking form, a list of services that the barbershop will provide along with a pricelist. a portfolio of images from the barbers clients and a page that introduces each of the members of staff.
